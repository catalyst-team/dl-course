# Homework 2

Hi!
Next **two week** you are going to solve two computer vision tasks:

- Classify objects
- Segment flower blooms

In `classification` and `segmentation` folders you can find a baseline model, data processing and submission generator script.
You have to rewrite data processing script and model code.
Read `README.md` in each folder closely.

## Scoring

Each task is worth 10 points. But final score of this homework will be calculated by this formula:
```
final_score = 0.3 * classification_score + 0.7 * segmentation_score
```
E.g, if you have full score of classification task and half of segmentation task,
you final score is `0.3 * 10 + 0.7 * 5 = 6.5` for this homework.

To get full score, your submission metrics must be greater than mentioned score in task `README.md`.
If get lower than mentioned score, but you model performance better than baseline, you will have score depend on how far your results from baseline.
