# Homework 3

Hi! Your next task is quite practical. 
You need to implement two methods for metric learning pipeline.
These are `Hard Cluster Sampling` ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10325)) and `Hierarchical Triplet Loss` ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06951.pdf)).
To check your implementation, you have a prepared Jupyter notebook with the Omniglot dataset.

## Score
Each method costs 5 points. The whole task costs 10 points.
