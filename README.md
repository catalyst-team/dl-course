[![dls-catalyst-course](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-pics/blob/master/pics/catalyst-dl-course-poster-eng.png)](https://github.com/catalyst-team/dl-course)

This is an open deep learning course made by [Deep Learning School](https://dlschool.org), [Tinkoff](https://tinkoff.ru), and [Catalyst team](https://github.com/catalyst-team). 
Lectures and practice notebooks located in ```./week*``` folders. Homeworks are in ```./homework*``` folders.

> *Note: the course is under update: 
> weeks with colab barge are ready to go, weeks with [WIP] label are still in progress. 
> You could use the `v20.12` branch for the earlier version of the full course.*
