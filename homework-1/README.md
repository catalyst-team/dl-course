# Homework 1

This homework is about autograd and gentle introduction to Catalyst framework.
Engine part is almost copied from Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
Nevertheless you should implement some operators by yourself.
You should start from `micrograd/engine.py`, after that, when you implement backend you can move to 
`micrograd/nn.py` where you should implement PyTorch-like frontend. Also don't forget to implement optimizer
in `micrograd/optim.py`. And the last thing: let's train small network on a toy dataset and see how our network can
solve this task `test_nn.ipynb`. 

Good luck!
